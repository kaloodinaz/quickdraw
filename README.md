# Quick Draw – Interactive AI Drawing Game

[Play Quick Draw (hosted version)](https://kaloodinaz.github.io/quickdraw/)

## Overview

Quick Draw is a fun, web-based game that challenges you to sketch a prompted object in **20 seconds**, while a **neural network** (a type of machine learning model) tries to guess what you're drawing in real time. It blends creativity with AI and is part of Google's AI Experiments series. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Gameplay & Purpose

- You're given a prompt (e.g. "bicycle," "microwave") and have just **20 seconds** to draw it. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- The AI constantly guesses as you draw, often starting from vague shapes and refining its guess as more detail appears. This gives an intuitive glimpse into how neural networks interpret visual data piece by piece. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- The goal isn’t just entertainment—your doodles help train and improve the AI’s recognition abilities, adding to a massive dataset of user drawings over time. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## Why It Matters

- **Educational value**: It's a playful way to experience firsthand how AI "sees" and learns from incomplete information.
- **Dataset contribution**: Each drawing feeds into a large-scale collection used for machine learning research and innovation.
- **Cultural snapshot**: The dataset reveals fascinating insights into how people across the world visualize and simplify objects. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## How to Play

1. Follow the link above to open the game in your browser.
2. Start playing—draw the prompt that appears within 20 seconds.
3. Watch the AI try to guess your drawing before time runs out.
4. After six rounds, view your performance: what the AI guessed, how close it got, and compare your sketch to others.
